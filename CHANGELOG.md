# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

The published site is versioned by IOS XE release; the `Unreleased` section captures changes
not yet reflected in a tagged release of the upstream YANG models.

---

## Versions Supported

The site serves these IOS XE releases under one GitHub Pages URL with an in-app version
selector (see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for the architecture).

| Version | YangModels path | Status | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 26.1.1  | `vendor/cisco/xe/2611`  | active **(default)** | Newest release; site default |
| 17.18.1 | `vendor/cisco/xe/17181` | active | Baseline for legacy in-place artifacts |
| 17.15.x | `vendor/cisco/xe/17151` | active | |
| 17.12.x | `vendor/cisco/xe/17121` | active | |
| 17.9.x  | `vendor/cisco/xe/1791`  | active | Oldest supported release |

Tree-module counts are monotonic across versions: 620 / 637 / 683 / 715 / 742 (17.9.x → 26.1.1).

Adding additional patches/minors is the mechanical runbook in [VERSIONING.md §8](VERSIONING.md#8-adding-a-new-release--runbook).

## What's New in 26.1.1

Highlights for users coming from 17.x. This is a curated summary; see the
release-tagged sections below for full per-round detail.

- **+27 net new YANG modules** vs 17.18.1 (742 vs 715 tree modules); +122 modules vs 17.9.x (620).
- **Per-release artefacts** under [releases/26.1.1/](releases/26.1.1/) —
  search index, YANG accountability report, Postman collections, Bruno collections,
  prefix map, and viewer manifests, all version-pinned. The hub's version selector
  resolves these at runtime.
- **Deeper cfg + oper specs** — `generate_cfg_from_tree.py` and `generate_oper_from_tree.py`
  now emit depth-8 trees, producing ~4× more cfg paths, ~7.8× more oper paths and
  ~10.8× more native paths over the legacy depth-4 cap.
- **MDT telemetry builder** — `telemetry.html` derives a paste-ready
  `telemetry ietf subscription` snippet from any operational xpath, with curated
  tier / cadence / on-change annotations folded in when matched.
- **Site quality bar** — Lighthouse strict mode + axe-core gates every deploy;
  PWA service worker enables offline browsing of the shell.
- **Tooling parity across releases** — all five active releases (17.9.x, 17.12.x,
  17.15.x, 17.18.1, 26.1.1) pass the same strict pyang validation and ship the
  same set of artefacts.

## Development Effort

Estimated active development time, derived from git commit timestamps with a
git-hours model: commits within **120 minutes** of each other count as one
working session, and each session is credited **+30 minutes** of ramp-up for
its first commit. This is an approximation — git records *when* work was
committed, not hours actually worked — so read it as a relative-effort signal,
not a timesheet. Refresh or re-tune the numbers anytime with:

    python -X utf8 scripts/estimate_dev_hours.py --by day

**Totals (as of 2026-07-28):** 480 commits across 67 sessions, roughly
**147 hours** of active development between 2026-02-01 and 2026-07-28
(~0.83 h/day averaged over the 178-day span; work is bursty, so per-day rows
below are far more representative than the average).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Live device data: real captured RESTCONF responses + interactive browser (round 30, 2026-07-31)

- **Real device responses injected into the specs.** Every operational and
  config GET was captured from physical Catalyst hardware (starting with a
  C9300-24UX on IOS XE 26.1.1, for Cisco Live 2026 / DEVNET-1232) and folded
  into the OpenAPI specs as a new `x-cisco-live-examples` vendor extension on
  the GET `200` media type. The synthetic, schema-typed `example` is left
  untouched — the real data sits alongside it. The extension is keyed by device
  **PID**, so the same path can carry samples from multiple platforms
  (`C9300-24UX`, `C9400`, `C9500`, `C9600`, …). Additive metadata only: path /
  operation / module counts are unchanged (G-6 safe).
- **New interactive Live Data browser — [live-data.html](live-data.html).**
  A dedicated hub page for exploring the captured responses: **device platform
  tabs** (one per PID), **per-category coverage cards** (captured vs total paths
  for the active device), a **searchable module / path browser** with category
  filters, and a **drill-down** that fetches the single per-module spec on demand
  and shows the exact response the switch returned. Deep-linkable
  (`?ver=…#module=…&path=…&pid=…`); CSP-safe (external JS, DOM-only, no
  `innerHTML`). Reachable from the hub Tools bar.
- **In-viewer banner.** Every `swagger-*-model` viewer now shows a compact
  "Live device data" banner above a module's spec when real captures exist for
  it, deep-linking into the Live Data browser. It reads a small per-release
  index (not the full spec) and refreshes on in-page module switches — fixing a
  stale-panel bug where a previous module's data could linger (the viewer swaps
  modules via `history.replaceState`, which does not fire `hashchange`).
- **Build pipeline + committable data.** The harness emits a gitignored sidecar
  (`references/live-examples-<ver>.json`) from the local captures;
  `scripts/apply_cisco_live_examples_overlay.py` stamps it onto the release
  specs, and `scripts/build_live_examples_index.py` emits the committed
  lightweight `releases/<ver>/live-examples-index.json` (coverage + navigation,
  no bodies) that the page and banner consume. Both steps are wired into
  `scripts/build_release.py`. Raw captures and credentials stay local (gitignored);
  only the injected specs and the small index are published.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v92-2026.07.30e`; `live-data.html` + `live-data.js`
  added to the precache list.

### Added — Native completeness, workflow analytics, dark mode & richer examples (round 29, 2026-07-30)

- **Native config model — deep augment backfill to every release.** Only 26.1.1
  shipped the fully augment/uses-resolved `native-aug-*.json` specs; the four
  older releases carried a *shallow* native model (base `container native` only),
  missing the routing / ip / ipv6 / crypto / snmp-server / nat / line / vrf /
  logging / parameter-map subtrees that ~130 external `Cisco-IOS-XE-*` modules
  contribute via `augment` and cross-module `uses`. Ran
  `scripts/generate_native_augmented.py --interface-mode skip --max-depth 5` for
  17.9.x / 17.12.x / 17.15.x / 17.18.1, adding **+21,141 / +21,556 / +23,356 /
  +24,265** RESTCONF config paths respectively. The `/native/interface`
  mega-container is left as already shipped on the older releases to stay within
  the site size budget; 26.1.1 continues to carry full interface augments.
  Per-release `search-index.json` + `_paths_index.json` rebuilt, manifests
  reconciled, `release_counts.json` baseline refreshed. All five releases pass
  `validate_release.py` gates 1–6, the strict path-depth audit, and the G-1 gate.
  `releases/**` is service-worker network-only, so no cache bump is required.

- **Complete workflow analytics lifecycle.** `assets/js/analytics.js` gained
  `startWorkflow()` / `completeWorkflow()` with a correlated `workflow_id`,
  `duration_ms`, and a `status` of `success | failed | abandoned`. Failures now
  emit `status: 'failed'` with an `error_type` — `missing_host` / `missing_path`
  when the code generator has no runnable target, `spec_load_failed` when a
  telemetry module spec cannot be fetched. Any workflow still open when the page
  is left is flushed as `abandoned` on `pagehide` (not `visibilitychange`, so a
  tab-switch-and-return is not miscounted). Two new canonical workflows join
  `code_generated` and `telemetry_subscription_built`: **`spec_explored`**
  (opening a spec in a viewer → expanding an operation) and
  **`data_model_explored`** (selecting an event model in Notifications → copying
  an example). This enables free PostHog funnels and drop-off/duration trends.

- **Dark-mode correctness across the site.** The hub, `tree-compare.html`, and
  all nine `swagger-*-model` viewers now render correctly in dark mode. The hub
  and compare page had an inline `[data-theme="dark"]` variable block that tied
  with `site.css`'s `--c-surface` tokens at equal specificity (site.css loaded
  later, so it won and surfaces stayed light); raising the inline block to
  `:root[data-theme="dark"]` fixes it. The viewers already had an extensive dark
  theme in `assets/css/viewer.css`; the one remaining gap — the hardcoded
  `body { background:#fafafa }` in each viewer's inline `<style>` — is now
  overridden with a dark base background applied to all nine viewers at once.

- **Richer, schema-typed examples.** `scripts/enrich_v2_specs.py` gained
  schema-type-paired enrichment (enum/format awareness, operational-telemetry
  heuristics, PID disambiguation, placeholder replacement) and was applied across
  all five releases and all nine categories, replacing generic placeholder values
  with realistic, type-correct example data wherever the flattened GET schemas
  allow it.

- **Category card icons + service worker** bumped to `v88-2026.07.30a`.

### Changed — Hub navigation redesign: compact Tools / Models / Docs bar (round 28, 2026-07)

- **One tidy, left-aligned quick-nav bar.** The hub's top toolbar was a
  crowded, centre-justified wrap of a dozen equally-weighted pills (a lone
  "Platform Coverage" kept orphaning onto its own line). It is now a single
  compact bar split into three labelled, divider-separated groups:
  **Tools** (interactive features), **Models** (the 9 data-model viewers),
  and **Docs** (App Map, About, GitHub, Changelog).
- **Primary tools stay visible; secondary tools fold into a "More" menu.**
  Search, Code Generator, YANG Report, Telemetry & Notifications, and Exports
  remain as top-level pills. Compare Trees, Compare Versions, Trees, and
  Platform Coverage moved into a **More** dropdown. The dropdown is a pure-CSS
  native `<details>` element with **no JavaScript**, so it respects the hub's
  strict `script-src 'self'` CSP and is keyboard-accessible for free.
- **Auto-hide hardened.** The scroll-away nav collapse now also toggles
  `visibility` and `pointer-events`, so switching the bar to `overflow:visible`
  (needed so the dropdown can escape the bar) never leaves invisible but
  still-clickable links hovering over the page when the nav is hidden.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v79-2026.07.17d`.

### Added — Shareable deep-links + xpath usage analytics on Telemetry & Notifications (round 27, 2026-07)

- **Copy-a-link, reopen-the-same-view.** Both panes of `telemetry.html` — the
  **Telemetry XPaths** builder and the **Event Notifications** catalog — now
  serialize their full selection into the URL hash via `history.replaceState`
  (no history spam, no `hashchange` loops). A shared link restores the exact
  release, category, module, xpath, transport, and filters, and rebuilds the
  subscription snippet.
- **Non-clobbering hash schema.** The two panes own disjoint keys — Telemetry
  XPaths owns `tab / ver / cat / mod / xpath / xport`; Event Notifications owns
  `q / ntransport / ncat / nmod`; `ver` and `tab` are shared. Each pane
  preserves the other's keys when it writes, so switching tabs never wipes the
  other pane's state. A new **Copy link** button was added to each pane.
- **XPath usage analytics.** `telemetry_xpath_used` and `telemetry_xpath_copied`
  now carry `xpath`, `yang_model`, `model_category`, and `transport`, so the
  analytics dashboards can report which telemetry xpaths and YANG models people
  actually build subscriptions from. All keys pass the analytics PII allow-list.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v77-2026.07.17b`.

### Added — Privacy-first product analytics: PostHog + Microsoft Clarity (round 26, 2026-07)

- **One wrapper, two providers.** Added `assets/js/analytics.js` exposing
  `window.analytics`, which fans every event out to both **PostHog** (product
  analytics / funnels / breakdowns) and **Microsoft Clarity** (heatmaps and
  session recordings). It also re-points the legacy `window.__iosxeTrack` hook
  through itself, so existing call sites reach PostHog too.
- **Public, swappable config.** `assets/js/analytics-config.js` holds the
  PostHog public `phc_` project key + host and the app-version / environment
  overrides. The key is a client-side write key (safe to ship, like a Clarity
  id); leaving the placeholder disables PostHog while Clarity keeps working
  (fail-open, never breaks a page).
- **Privacy by default.** Honors the browser **Do-Not-Track** signal for both
  providers; a `sanitize()` layer drops or redacts PII (emails, IPv4s,
  hostnames, serials, tokens, full URLs) before any event leaves the browser;
  autocapture, pageview URL capture, and cross-page session URLs are off, and
  only a curated allow-list of non-PII keys (`yang_model`, `xpath`, `api_path`,
  `model_category`, `release`, `transport`, `http_code`, `result`,
  `page_or_section`) is forwarded.
- **Events wired across the site.** `app_loaded`, `data_model_selected`,
  `api_operation_selected`, `api_request` / `api_error`, `export_results`,
  and `workflow_completed`, plus the telemetry / notifications specifics above.
  See `docs/ANALYTICS.md` for the full event table and dashboard breakdowns.
- **Service worker** precaches the analytics files; consolidated at
  `v76-2026.07.17a`.

### Security — externalize SW registration + regression tests (round 25, 2026)

- **Closed the CSP / inline-script gap.** Top-level pages ship
  `script-src 'self'` (no `'unsafe-inline'`), but the PWA service
  worker registration + update-toast block was injected inline,
  which modern browsers refuse to execute. The whole snippet moved
  to `assets/js/sw-register.js` and `scripts/inject_pwa.py` now
  emits `<script src="assets/js/sw-register.js" defer></script>`.
  The new module derives its SW URL + scope from
  `document.currentScript.src`, so the same file works from the
  site root and from every viewer subdirectory.
- **Added `tests/test_security_regressions.py`** with three
  parameterised guards: (a) URL-fragment / query-string values
  must not flow into `innerHTML`/`outerHTML`/`document.write`/
  `insertAdjacentHTML`; (b) `location.href`/`assign`/`replace`
  assignments built from concatenation must carry a whitelist
  guard for the destination (catches the round-24
  `javascript:` URL exploit shape); (c) strict-CSP pages must
  not contain inline executable `<script>` blocks (JSON-LD data
  blocks and external `<script src=...>` exempted). 44 new
  assertions, all green.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v18-2026.05.23` and now precaches
  `assets/js/sw-register.js` so offline reloads still see the new
  module.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 24]
### Security — Reflected-XSS fixes in 404 + hub deep-link (round 24, 2026)

- **Fixed reflected XSS in `404.html` hash-recovery flow.** When the
  deep-link recovery routine surfaces the “Redirecting you to …”
  notice, the values of `params.spec` and `params.op` (parsed from
  the URL fragment) used to flow into `innerHTML` unescaped. A
  crafted URL like `/404.html#spec=Cisco-IOS-XE-mib<img src=x
  onerror=...>` would have executed the payload. The notice is now
  assembled with DOM nodes (`textContent` / `createElement`) so the
  fragment is rendered as text.
- **Fixed open-redirect / `javascript:` URL injection on the hub
  `#spec=model/name` deep-link.** `search.js` previously did
  `window.location.href = modelDir + '/index.html#spec=' + specName`
  with no validation, allowing `#spec=javascript:alert(1)/x` to
  execute the JS payload via the `javascript:` URL scheme. The
  redirect now refuses any `modelDir` that isn’t in the known
  whitelist of viewer category directories, and `specName` is
  `encodeURIComponent`-encoded.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v17-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 23]

### Added — 404 polish, format-detection, robots noindex (round 23, 2026)

- **404 page polish.** Now declares `theme-color` (light/dark variants)
  so the mobile status bar matches the rest of the site, and emits
  `robots: noindex, follow` so search engines don’t index error pages.
- **`format-detection: telephone=no`** added to every top-level page so
  iOS Safari stops auto-linking version numbers like `17.9.5` and
  module dotted-paths as phone numbers.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v16-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 22]

### Added — Heading permalink anchors (round 22, 2026)

- **Heading anchors.** Long-form pages tagged with
  `<body data-anchors="on">` now grow a small pilcrow (¶) next to
  each `h2[id]`/`h3[id]`/`h4[id]` on hover or keyboard focus. Click
  the pilcrow to jump to that section *and* copy the deep-link URL to
  the clipboard so it can be shared. Enabled on `about.html`; other
  pages can opt in by setting the body attribute.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v15-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 21]

### Added — BreadcrumbList + viewer ItemList JSON-LD (round 21, 2026)

- **BreadcrumbList structured data** on every top-level non-hub page
  (About, Accountability, Tree Compare, Code Generator, Exports,
  Telemetry) — helps Google render breadcrumbs in search results.
- **Hub ItemList JSON-LD** enumerating all 9 viewer categories (Native
  config / oper, Operational, IETF, OpenConfig, RPC, Events, MIB,
  Other) so search engines can surface direct links to each category.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v14-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 20]

### Added — Footer aria-current, Edit-on-GitHub, robots hints (round 20, 2026)

- **Footer marks the active page.** Links in the global footer that
  point at the page you’re currently viewing now emit
  `aria-current="page"` so screen readers announce them as the
  current location, and a subtle bold/solid-underline treatment makes
  the active link easy to spot visually.
- **Edit on GitHub.** Top-level pages (hub, About, Accountability,
  Compare, Code Gen, Exports, Telemetry) now expose an `Edit on
  GitHub` link in the footer that opens the current page’s source
  file in the GitHub web editor on a new tab. Subdir viewer pages
  (which are generated) deliberately omit the link.
- **`max-image-preview:large` robots hint** added on every top-level
  page so Google can render rich, larger thumbnails in search results.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v13-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 19]

### Added — Hub SearchAction, offline 404 hint (round 19, 2026)

- **Hub JSON-LD extended with `SearchAction`.** Google can now show a
  sitelinks search box that posts queries to
  `https://…/?q={search_term_string}`. `search.js` bridges `?q=` to the
  existing `#search=` deep-link format, so the SearchAction lands on a
  real, fully-rendered result list. JSON-LD also now declares
  `publisher: Cisco DevNet` and `inLanguage: en`.
- **404 offline hint.** When `navigator.onLine === false`, the 404 page
  rewrites its message to explain that the page may exist but couldn’t
  load, and reminds the visitor that cached pages (Home, About,
  Accountability, Compare, Code Gen, Exports) still work. When the
  browser comes back online, an inline note suggests reloading.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v12-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 18]

### Added — Search clear button, SEO JSON-LD (round 18, 2026)

- **Native search clear-X on all filter inputs.** Switched the universal
  search box (hub), modules filter (accountability), spec picker filter
  (code generator), and both per-side tree filters (tree-compare) from
  `<input type="text">` to `<input type="search">`. Browsers render a
  built-in clear button when there's content, and `autocomplete="off"` +
  `spellcheck="false"` keep autofill/red-squiggle noise out of the way.
- **Themed clear button.** Added a custom
  `::-webkit-search-cancel-button` rule in [assets/css/site.css](cisco-ios-xe-openapi-swagger/assets/css/site.css) so the X is
  visible on both light and dark backgrounds (it's near-invisible by
  default in dark mode).
- **JSON-LD structured data on About page.** Added a Schema.org `WebSite`
  + `WebPage` + `Organization` graph so search engines surface the page
  with rich metadata (name, audience, publisher). No CSP impact —
  `application/ld+json` isn't an executable script.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v11-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 17]

### Added — Telemetry shortcuts, smooth anchors (round 17, 2026)

- **Telemetry page shortcut keys.** New keybindings surfaced in the `?`
  dialog: `/` focus path filter, `E` Export CSV, `C` Copy YANG-push snippet.
  Same INPUT/TEXTAREA guard pattern as the other page-level shortcut sets.
- **Smooth anchor scrolling + sticky-header offset.** Anchor links now
  scroll with `scroll-behavior: smooth` site-wide, and every heading /
  section with an `id` reserves `scroll-margin-top: 80px` so the jumped-to
  element clears any sticky nav (e.g. the tree-compare controls bar)
  instead of hiding behind it. Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v10-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 16]

### Added — Hub shortcut, tree-compare empty state (round 16, 2026)

- **Hub keyboard shortcut: `/` or `Ctrl/Cmd+K` focuses the universal search.**
  The search box placeholder has long advertised this, and now it actually
  works. Honors INPUT/TEXTAREA/contentEditable guards. Surfaced in the `?`
  help dialog.
- **Tree-compare empty-state placeholders.** Before any module is chosen,
  each side of the split view now shows a friendly empty state
  (&ldquo;Pick a module above ←&rdquo; / &ldquo;→&rdquo;) that explains what the panel
  does, mentions sync-scroll + diff highlighting, and hints at the `?`
  shortcut. Styled to match the surrounding viewer chrome and to work in
  both light and dark themes.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v9-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 15]

### Added — Copy-as-text, footer build link, SW precache (round 15, 2026)

- **Copy as Text on yang-accountability.** New `Copy as Text` button next to
  `Export CSV` produces a paste-ready plain-text report of the currently
  filtered modules: header summary (release, totals, filter state) plus an
  aligned name/spec/tree/categories table. Truncates after 200 rows with a
  `+N more` footer and points at CSV for the full set. Uses clipboard API
  with execCommand fallback for older browsers.
- **Page shortcut keys on yang-accountability.** New keybindings surfaced in
  the `?` dialog: `E` Export CSV, `T` Copy as Text, `L` Share Link, `/`
  focus search box. Standard guards for INPUT/TEXTAREA/contentEditable
  targets.
- **Build badge in footer links to changelog.** The `Build v… (round N)`
  label in the global footer is now an anchor to
  `CHANGELOG.md#unreleased`, with a dotted underline that turns solid on
  hover, so anyone can see exactly what shipped in this build.
- **Service worker precache widened.** Added `about.html`,
  `yang-accountability.html`, `tree-compare.html`, `code-generator.html`,
  and `exports.html` to the precache list so the top-level navigation
  resolves instantly after the first visit / installs PWA mode with
  the full app shell available offline.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v8-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 14]

### Added — Issue templates, skeletons, PWA install, perf hints (round 14, 2026)

- **GitHub issue + PR templates.** New `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with three
  templates (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`, `spec_accuracy.md`) and a
  `config.yml` that disables blank issues, routes upstream YANG bugs to
  `YangModels/yang`, and links to Cisco DevNet + GitHub Discussions. New
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` covers change type, validation checklist,
  screenshots, and reviewer notes — making the About-page &ldquo;Open a bug
  report&rdquo; / &ldquo;Request a feature&rdquo; deep links land on a guided form.
- **Loading skeleton on `yang-accountability.html`.** While the per-release
  JSON is in flight, the table now renders eight pulse-animated skeleton rows
  and stat-card placeholders instead of an empty table. Honors
  `prefers-reduced-motion`, dark-mode aware. Skeleton CSS in
  [assets/css/site.css](assets/css/site.css) is reusable (`.skeleton-bar`,
  `.skeleton-row`).
- **PWA install prompt UX.** `site-chrome.js` now intercepts
  `beforeinstallprompt`, suppresses the browser default mini-infobar, and
  surfaces a dismissable Install / Not&nbsp;now toast (bottom-left, dark-mode
  aware, responsive). &ldquo;Not now&rdquo; sets a 30-day cooldown in
  localStorage; if the user starts the prompt but cancels we cool down for 7
  days; if they install we never prompt again. Opt-out via
  `<body data-pwa-prompt="off">`.
- **Performance hints.** Added `<link rel="preconnect">` to
  `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` on the four top-level pages
  that pull Roboto / Roboto Mono (index, code-generator, yang-accountability,
  about). Trims first-paint cost on cold-cache visits.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v7-2026.05.23`.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 13]

### Added — About page, engagement CTAs, footer links (round 13, 2026)

- **New `about.html`** — a technical-marketing landing page covering project
  mission, by-the-numbers stats (608 specs / 37,072 paths / 1,125 modules /
  765 trees / 9 categories / 5 releases / 100% accountability), what you can
  do here (8 capability cards), releases table, architecture summary, and a
  dedicated &ldquo;Open an issue, give feedback, or contribute&rdquo; section
  with deep links into the GitHub bug-report / feature-request templates,
  Discussions, CONTRIBUTING.md, and the changelog. Credits / licensing block
  clarifies upstream YangModels licensing, Swagger UI attribution, and the
  not-an-official-Cisco-product disclaimer.
- **Header nav and footer** now include an &ldquo;About&rdquo; link on every
  page; the shared footer also gains a direct &ldquo;Open an issue&rdquo;
  link to the GitHub Issues new-issue flow.
- **Sitemap** grown to 17 entries with `about.html` and refreshed `lastmod`.
- **Emoji-guard test** now also gates `about.html`, keeping the page free of
  decorative glyphs while still allowing HTML entities like `&mdash;`,
  `&copy;`, and the functional KEEP-listed monochrome symbols.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v6-2026.05.23` so returning visitors land
  on the new About page and refreshed footer immediately.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 12]

### Added — Page shortcuts, shared footer, copy-as-text (round 12, 2026)

- **Page-specific keyboard shortcuts**. `tree-compare.html` now responds to
  `S` (Sync Scroll), `H` (Highlight Diffs), `E` (Export), `C` (Copy as Text),
  and `L` (Copy Share Link). `code-generator.html` responds to `G` (generate),
  `L` (Copy Share Link), `X` (Clear). Each page pushes its bindings onto
  `window.__SHORTCUTS` so the `?` help dialog shows them alongside the global
  shortcuts. All bindings ignore typing targets (inputs / textareas / selects /
  contenteditable) and modifier keys.
- **"Copy as Text" on `tree-compare.html`** — new button next to Export that
  copies the same side-by-side comparison report (header + Left tree + Right
  tree) to the clipboard with a 3-second "Copied!" flash and graceful
  fallback for older browsers.
- **Shared site footer** injected by `site-chrome.js` on every page (opt-out
  via `<body data-footer="off">`). Carries quick links (Home / Accountability /
  Compare / Exports / Changelog) and a build badge (`SITE_BUILD`) for cache-
  busting triage. Footer is hidden in print and styled for both light + dark
  themes; collapses to a stacked layout below 640 px.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v5-2026.05.22` so returning visitors pick up
  the new page bindings, Copy-as-Text button, and footer immediately.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 11]

### Added — UX polish, print, back-to-top, persistence (round 11, 2026)

- **Print stylesheet** — `@media print` block in
  [assets/css/site.css](assets/css/site.css) now hides chrome (headers, dark
  toggle, share/CSV buttons, Swagger UI topbar, iframes) and forces a light
  palette with bordered tables, page-break avoidance on rows/cards, and full
  URLs appended after external links. Yang accountability, telemetry, exports,
  and the compare matrices print cleanly to PDF.
- **Floating "Back to top" button** — site-chrome now injects a single shared
  Back-to-top control that appears after ~400 px of scroll on every page. Uses
  smooth scrolling, restores focus to `#main-content` / `main` / `h1`, ships
  proper `aria-label`/`title`, respects dark mode, and may be suppressed per
  page via `<body data-back-to-top="off">`.
- **Tree-compare toggle persistence** — `Sync Scroll` and `Highlight Diffs`
  states are now persisted to `localStorage` (`iosxe-tree-compare-prefs`) and
  rehydrated on load with `aria-pressed` reflecting the active state.
- **Empty-state polish on yang-accountability** — when filters return zero
  modules the empty row now shows a friendlier message plus a "Clear filters"
  button that wipes the search box, resets category + status to `all`, syncs
  the filter-button visuals, refreshes the hash, and focuses the search box.
- **Service worker** bumped to `v4-2026.05.22` so returning visitors pick up
  the print stylesheet + back-to-top button immediately.

## [Pre-Unreleased — round 10]

### Added — UX polish, deep-links, CSV export (round 10, 2026)

- **Keyboard shortcut help dialog** — press `?` on any page to open a focused,
  Esc-dismissable modal listing global shortcuts (`/`, `Ctrl+K`, `Esc`, `Tab`,
  `Shift+Tab`, `Enter`). Implemented in [assets/js/site-chrome.js](assets/js/site-chrome.js)
  with proper focus management (returns focus on close, `aria-modal`,
  `aria-labelledby`). Pages may extend via `window.__SHORTCUTS`. A discoverable
  "? Shortcuts" button sits next to the hub search bar.
- **`yang-accountability.html` Export CSV** — downloads the currently-filtered rows
  as a UTF-8 BOM, RFC 4180-quoted `.csv` named
  `yang-accountability-<ver>-<date>.csv`. Columns: Module Name, Classification,
  Categories, Has Spec, Has Tree, Spec URLs, Tree URL, Reason Excluded.
- **`telemetry.html` Export CSV** — downloads visible Method / OpenAPI path / MDT
  filter xpath rows as
  `telemetry-paths-<ver>-<spec>-<date>.csv` honoring the active path filter.
- **`yang-accountability.html` deep-links + Copy Share Link** — URL hash now
  preserves `ver`, `q`, `cat`, `status`; filter buttons sync to URL on every
  change. A new Copy Share Link button reproduces the exact filter state.
- **`code-generator.html` deep-links + Copy Share Link + version-aware picker** —
  `ver=&category=&spec=&path=&method=` hash schema; per-release search-index
  fallback; never persists credentials.
- **`exports.html` filter bar** — release dropdown + Postman / Bruno / All
  toggle with hash sync (`#ver=&format=`), live totals (requests + bytes), and
  basename-only Path display with full path in tooltip.
- **Postman split-by-category** — each release ships 9 per-category Postman v2.1
  collections to stay under GitHub's 50 MB recommended limit. Max shard 22.7 MB
  (native-config 26.1.1).
- **Sitemap refresh + sitemap generator** — `python scripts/generate_sitemap.py`
  refreshes `lastmod` on all 16 entries to today.
- **Accessibility** — `aria-label` on filter inputs across code-generator,
  yang-accountability, yang-accountability-compare, tree-compare, telemetry;
  keyboard-activatable native-config search-clear span; close-button
  `aria-label` on the code-snippet modal.
- **Generator output paths** — Postman + Bruno manifests now write POSIX paths
  (forward slashes) regardless of host OS, so download links on the live site
  work correctly when generators run on Windows.
- **Terminology** — "Has Swagger Spec:" → "Has OpenAPI Spec:" on the hub.
- **Service worker** — `CACHE_VERSION` bumped to `v3-2026.05.22` to ensure
  returning visitors pick up this round's changes.

### Added — Site quality, PWA, and per-release exports (round 9, 2026)

- **Lighthouse strict + axe-core CI** — site quality gates (Tier 3) added to the deploy
  workflow, blocking regressions in performance, accessibility, best-practices, and SEO.
- **JSON minify + htmlhint** (Tier 4) — deploy step now minifies JSON data files and runs
  htmlhint over every shipped HTML page.
- **search-index v3.1 slim-down** (Tier 5 + 8) —
  [scripts/generate_search_index.py](scripts/generate_search_index.py) now drops empty
  fields and truncates module descriptions at a 160-char word boundary (down from 250).
  Combined effect: `search-index.json` shipped size 1,124,074 → 1,096,810 B (−2.4%
  pretty, larger savings post-CI minify); `max-desc-len` capped at 162.
- **PWA service worker + manifest** (Tier 6) — [service-worker.js](service-worker.js)
  pre-caches the app shell and serves it offline. [site.webmanifest](site.webmanifest)
  registered on all 17 top-level pages by [scripts/inject_pwa.py](scripts/inject_pwa.py).
- **Deep-link scroll-position memory** (Tier 7) — [deeplink.js](deeplink.js) now stores
  the last `op=` location under `iosxe-scroll-<spec>` and restores it after spec load,
  so refreshing or returning to a deep-link lands on the same operation row instead of
  the top of the page.
- **Update-available toast** (Tier 9) — when a new service worker reaches `installed`
  while an existing controller is in charge, all pages surface a small bottom-right
  card with a Reload button. Reload posts `{type:'SKIP_WAITING'}`; the
  `controllerchange` listener then refreshes the page exactly once.
  `CACHE_VERSION` bumped to `v2-2026.05.20`. Inline registration is CSP-safe
  (`role=status`, `aria-live=polite`, dismiss button, fail-silent).
- **Per-release Postman + Bruno exports for all 5 releases** — `releases/<ver>/exports/`
  now exists for 17.9.x, 17.12.x, 17.15.x, 17.18.1 and 26.1.1, each with 9 per-category
  Postman v2.1 collections, a Postman environment, a `postman-manifest.json`, and a
  `bruno-manifest.json`. Bruno collection content remains git-ignored and is
  regenerated locally via
  [scripts/generate_bruno_collection.py](scripts/generate_bruno_collection.py).
  Per-release request totals: 17.9.x=52,170 / 17.12.x=54,164 / 17.15.x=58,874 /
  17.18.1=68,353 / 26.1.1=63,541.
- **`Cisco-IOS-XE-bgp-route-oper` exclusion reason** — `yang_accountability.json` (root
  + all 5 per-release files) and [YANG_MODULE_ACCOUNTABILITY.md](YANG_MODULE_ACCOUNTABILITY.md)
  updated to record `"Source YANG not bundled with model package"` instead of `null`.
- **[FAQ.md](FAQ.md)** — new top-level FAQ covering offline use, Catalyst 9k API
  discovery, on-device validation, MDT subscription, and Postman/Bruno consumption.

### Added — Hub-level cross-category operation search & d8 spec depth (round 8, 2026)

- **[hub-search-ops.js](hub-search-ops.js)** — augments the universal search box on the
  landing page (`#universalSearch`) with a new "Operations matching" section that surfaces
  individual API operations across all 9 viewer categories. Lazy-loads each category's
  `_paths_index.json` (built by [scripts/build_paths_index.py](scripts/build_paths_index.py))
  on the first user query and caches in memory. Each hit renders HTTP-method badges
  (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE colour-coded) and clicks deep-link to
  `swagger-<cat>-model/index.html#spec=<module>&op=<operationId>`, handled by
  [deeplink.js](deeplink.js) in each viewer (auto-loads spec, expands the operation row).
  CSP-strict (same-origin script, no `eval`, no inline handlers).
- **Depth-d8 cfg / oper specs (26.1.1)** — `generate_cfg_from_tree.py` and
  `generate_oper_from_tree.py` `max_depth` raised from 6 → 8 in both `collect_deep_paths()`
  and `process_tree_file()`. 26.1.1 now publishes:
  - cfg : 2559 paths, 10083 operations, 40 specs (+25 paths at d7 + d8)
  - oper: 22144 paths, 215 specs (+566 paths at d7 + d8)
- **Audit floor tightened** — [scripts/audit_path_depth.py](scripts/audit_path_depth.py)
  `MIN_MAX_DEPTH` raised cfg / oper 6 → 7. Strict mode now blocks any future regression
  below d7 for those two categories.
- **17.x backport (shipped)** — the from-tree generators were rolled out to 17.9.x, 17.12.x
  and 17.15.x via `_resolve_paths(version)` (`releases/<ver>/yang-trees/`). Followed by
  `enrich`, `github-links`, `external-docs`, `tree-links`, `mdt-annotate`, `manifests`,
  `stamp-spec-count`, `search-index` and `path-depth-audit`. Depth gains:
  - 17.9.x : cfg 643→2519 (d2→d8), oper 1907→17136 (d3→d8), events 52→699 (d1→d2)
  - 17.12.x: cfg 601→2512 (d2→d8), oper 2226→19042 (d3→d8), events 54→710 (d1→d2)
  - 17.15.x: cfg 579→2546 (d2→d8), oper 2426→20465 (d3→d8), events 70→799 (d1→d2)
  All four active releases (17.9.x, 17.12.x, 17.15.x, 26.1.1) now PASS the strict
  path-depth audit floor. 17.18.1 still uses the legacy top-level `api/` layout and was
  intentionally left untouched.

### Added — Path-depth audit, tree-based generators & cross-chunk operation search (rounds 6–7, 2026)

- **Tree-based generators for cfg / oper / events** —
  [generators/generate_cfg_from_tree.py](generators/generate_cfg_from_tree.py),
  [generators/generate_oper_from_tree.py](generators/generate_oper_from_tree.py) and
  [generators/generate_events_from_tree.py](generators/generate_events_from_tree.py)
  replace the older regex-based generators in [scripts/build_release.py](scripts/build_release.py)'s
  `cfg-specs`, `oper-specs` and `events-specs` steps. Tree parsers walk the pyang HTML
  output and emit one operation per node up to the configured `max_depth`, mirroring the
  same approach already used by the `native_from_tree` and `openconfig_from_tree`
  generators. On 26.1.1 this produced ~4× more cfg paths, ~7.8× more oper paths and ~10.8×
  more events paths versus the previous regex passes.
- **[scripts/audit_path_depth.py](scripts/audit_path_depth.py)** — new build step that
  walks every `releases/<ver>/swagger-<cat>-model/api/*.json`, computes a per-category
  depth distribution + `max-depth`, writes `releases/<ver>/path_depth_audit.json` and (in
  `--strict` mode, used by `build_release.py`) fails the build if any category is below its
  `MIN_MAX_DEPTH` floor. Floors at end of round 7: cfg=6, oper=6, native-config=6, ietf=3,
  openconfig=3, other=3, events=2, mib=2, rpc=1.
- **Cross-chunk operation search in all 9 viewers** — `paths-search.js` (canonical copy in
  [swagger-native-config-model/paths-search.js](swagger-native-config-model/paths-search.js))
  is wired into every viewer (`cfg`, `events`, `ietf`, `mib`, `native-config`, `openconfig`,
  `oper`, `other`, `rpc`). The IIFE hooks the viewer's `#searchBox` and queries the
  category-scoped `_paths_index.json`, so a path/op search resolves across **all** spec
  chunks in the category, not just the one currently rendered. 80 ms input debounce,
  `MIN_QUERY=2`, `MAX_HITS=60`. The hook self-skips on releases other than 26.1.1.
- **Spec-count manifest fixes** — both [scripts/stamp_spec_count.py](scripts/stamp_spec_count.py)
  and [scripts/update_manifests.py](scripts/update_manifests.py) now exclude `manifest.json`
  and `_paths_index.json` when counting specs, so the published counts stay correct after
  the paths-index file landed in `api/`.
- **Multi-root merge in `generate_cfg_from_tree.py`** — earlier the cfg generator emitted
  separate spec files per `data` root, causing 40 files vs 90 modules. The from-tree port
  now merges roots per module name (matching the oper generator), restoring 1-spec-per-module
  parity.

### Added — Module-driven Telemetry XPath Builder (round 5, April 2026)

- **[telemetry.html](telemetry.html) rewrite** — formerly a static dump of the 61 curated
  `telemetry-index.json` entries; now a two-tab tool. The default tab, **Module XPath Builder**,
  lets the user pick any release / category / module and renders the MDT
  `filter xpath` for **every** operation in that spec, derived live with the formula from
  [MDT_XPATH_SPEC.md](MDT_XPATH_SPEC.md) (`/<prefix>:<path-without-leading-slash>`). Each row
  has a "Use" button that drops the xpath into a ready-to-paste `telemetry ietf subscription`
  config snippet. Curated tier / cadence / on-change annotations from `telemetry-index.json`
  are folded in as enrichment when the derived xpath matches a catalogued entry. The original
  filterable curated table is preserved as the **Curated Catalog** tab.
- **[scripts/build_yang_prefix_map.py](scripts/build_yang_prefix_map.py)** — new build step that
  scans every `*.yang` file under each release's source directory, extracts the `prefix`
  statement, and emits `releases/<ver>/yang-prefix-map.json` (and a top-level
  `yang-prefix-map.json` for the legacy 17.18.1 in-place layout). Output schema:
  `{version, yang_source, module_count, modules: {moduleName: prefix}}`. Built today for all
  five active releases: 26.1.1 (887), 17.18.1 (848), 17.15.x (799), 17.12.x (719), 17.9.x (701).
- **Formula verified** against the existing curated 17.18.1 catalog: 60/61 entries match
  exactly; the single "mismatch" is a curator-chosen deeper xpath
  (`/interfaces-ios-xe-oper:interfaces/interface`) rooted on the same operation, not a
  formula bug.
- **[telemetry.js](telemetry.js)** — new external script (CSP `script-src 'self'` compliant);
  no inline JS in `telemetry.html`.

### Added — Site-wide version awareness & quality hardening (round 4, April 2026)

- **Version-aware viewers** — all 9 `swagger-*-model/index.html` viewers now resolve the active
  release at runtime via `__activeVer()` / `__apiBase()` / `__treeBase()` helpers injected by
  [scripts/patch_viewers_version_aware.py](scripts/patch_viewers_version_aware.py). The patcher
  reads `releases/index.json` once and bakes the default version + active-versions allow-list into
  each viewer as `__IOSXE_DEFAULT_VER__` / `__IOSXE_ALLOWED_VERS__`. Unknown `?ver=` values are
  rejected (no more 404 storms on bad URLs). Helper block is regex-replaceable for true idempotency,
  and the dead `getSpecFolder()` function was removed from all viewers.
- **[scripts/normalize_manifests.py](scripts/normalize_manifests.py)** — normalises every
  `manifest.json` (default + 4 release dirs × 9 categories = 45 manifests) to the viewer-expected
  schema: integer `total_modules` / `total_paths` / `total_operations` / `spec_count` summed from
  the sibling spec files, and `modules` as a flat list of string basenames. Fixes the viewer crash
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')`.
- **[scripts/smoke_live.py](scripts/smoke_live.py)** *(new, replaces `_debug_viewer.py`)* —
  headless Playwright smoke test of the live deployment. Loads version list from
  `releases/index.json`, walks every active release through the viewer, and exits non-zero on real
  failures (transient 503s ignored). `--base-url` flag for staging.
- **[tests/test_manifest_schema.py](tests/test_manifest_schema.py)** *(new)* — 46 parametrized
  pytest cases (45 manifests + 1 sanity) asserting required integer keys, `modules` as `list[str]`,
  count agreement, and that every listed module resolves to a sibling `.json` spec.
- **[.github/workflows/tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml)** *(new)* — runs the manifest-schema
  test suite on push/PR touching `swagger-*-model/`, `releases/`, `tests/`, the manifest
  normaliser, the viewer patcher, or itself.
- **[index-app.js](index-app.js)** — `applyVersion()` now rewrites all
  `a[href*="swagger-"][href*="-model/index.html"]` hrefs to carry `?ver=<v>` so category-card
  navigation preserves the active release.

### Fixed (round 4)

- **Manifest schema mismatch** across release directories — old-schema manifests (missing
  `total_paths` / `total_operations`, `modules` as objects rather than strings) caused the viewer
  to crash on load. All 45 manifests rewritten via `normalize_manifests.py`.
- **404 storms on malformed URLs** — `?ver=garbage` previously triggered ~150 spec 404s. Now
  validated against the allow-list baked into the viewer; falls back silently to the default.
- **Mojibake repaired in 7 viewers** — `â€"` → `—`, `ðŸŒ³` → ``, `ðŸ—„` → ``, etc., via `ftfy`.
  CSP meta tags verified present on all 9 viewers.
- **Patcher fragility** — anchor strings differed across viewers; idempotency previously relied on
  a substring sentinel. Replaced with a regex-replaceable helper block and a dead-code strip pass.

### Added — Multi-release foundations (April 2026)

- **`releases/<ver>/` per-release folder layout** — defined in [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md). Per-release
  folders hold OpenAPI specs, pyang trees, manifests, accountability JSON, search index,
  telemetry index, MIB metadata, native capabilities, and Postman/Bruno exports.
- **[VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md)** — new authoritative doc covering folder layout, URL contract,
  `meta.json` schema, manifest schema, "add a new release" runbook, and CI gates.
- **[MDT_XPATH_SPEC.md](MDT_XPATH_SPEC.md)** — new authoritative doc defining the
  `/<prefix>:<container-path>` MDT filter-xpath rule, OpenAPI `x-mdt-*` extensions, and
  `telemetry-index.json` schema.
- **[scripts/fetch_yang_release.py](scripts/fetch_yang_release.py)** — sparse, shallow clone of
  YangModels/yang for a single release; pins commit SHA in `releases/<ver>/meta.json`.
- **[scripts/generate_all_pyang_trees.py](scripts/generate_all_pyang_trees.py)** — version-aware tree
  generator that writes `releases/<ver>/yang-trees/` and a per-release `tree_audit.json` documenting
  every skip reason (`types-only`, `submodule`, `deviation-only`, `augment-only`, `empty-tree`).
- **[scripts/build_release.py](scripts/build_release.py)** — single-release pipeline orchestrator
  (specs → enrichment → trees → MDT annotation → MIB metadata → native capabilities → manifests
  → accountability → search → Postman → Bruno).
- **[scripts/build_all_releases.py](scripts/build_all_releases.py)** — iterates `releases/index.json`.
- **[scripts/validate_release.py](scripts/validate_release.py)** — local pre-flight that runs every
  CI gate from [VERSIONING.md §9](VERSIONING.md#9-ci-gates-per-release).
- **[scripts/migrate_to_releases_layout.py](scripts/migrate_to_releases_layout.py)** — one-shot
  migration of the current 17.18.1 artifacts into `releases/17.18.1/`. Default dry-run; `--apply`
  copies and `--remove-legacy` deletes the originals after copy.
- **[releases/index.json](releases/index.json)** — canonical list of releases consumed by the UI
  version selector.
- **[PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md §16](PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md#16-multi-release-phase-april-2026)** —
  new section locking the multi-release, MDT, native v2, MIB detail, exports, and accountability
  requirements.
- **CODE_REVIEW.md resolution banner** — confirms the three "Must-Fix Blockers" (XSS in `search.js`,
  localStorage silent-fail in `recent-favorites.js`, search-index race condition) are already
  resolved in code.

### Added — Multi-release scripts & UI surfaces (round 2, April 2026)

- **[scripts/_release_paths.py](scripts/_release_paths.py)** — shared `ReleasePaths` helper used by
  every new version-aware script; centralises `releases/<ver>/...` path resolution and provides
  `list_active_releases()` / `all_releases()` against `releases/index.json`.
- **[scripts/annotate_mdt_xpaths.py](scripts/annotate_mdt_xpaths.py)** — parses
  [`telemetry-reference.md`](telemetry-reference.md) and stamps `x-mdt-filter-xpath`,
  `x-mdt-tier`, `x-mdt-cadence-seconds`, `x-mdt-encoding`, `x-mdt-on-change-capable`,
  and `x-mdt-feature-section` onto matching oper-spec operations. Emits
  `releases/<ver>/telemetry-index.json` and `releases/<ver>/telemetry-skipped.json`.
- **[scripts/parse_mibs_md.py](scripts/parse_mibs_md.py)** — parses [MIBS.md](../MIBS.md) §3.5
  full-availability matrix, §2.x functional-category roles, and §1.5 latest-inventory list, writing
  `releases/<ver>/mib-platform-matrix.json`.
- **[scripts/enrich_mib_metadata.py](scripts/enrich_mib_metadata.py)** — extracts SMIv2 OID prefix,
  table/scalar/leaf counts, deprecated-object counts, latest-revision date, organization, and
  RFC reference from each MIB-derived YANG, then joins with the platform matrix into
  `releases/<ver>/mib-metadata.json`.
- **[scripts/build_native_capabilities.py](scripts/build_native_capabilities.py)** — counts paths,
  operations (per HTTP method), schemas, leafs, lists, and choices across every
  `swagger-native-config-model` spec, writing `releases/<ver>/native-capabilities.json` for the
  Config Capabilities summary page.
- **[scripts/build_accountability_compare.py](scripts/build_accountability_compare.py)** — reads
  every active release's `yang_accountability.json` and emits a unified cross-version matrix at
  `accountability_compare.json` (with `summary`, `deltas`, and per-module `by_version` rows)
  consumed by [yang-accountability-compare.html](yang-accountability-compare.html).
- **[scripts/generate_bruno_collection.py](scripts/generate_bruno_collection.py)** — emits one Bruno
  collection per (release, model-category) pair under `releases/<ver>/exports/bruno/`, with auto-split
  on the 50 MB cap and a top-level `bruno-manifest.json`.
- **[scripts/generate_postman_v2_collection.py](scripts/generate_postman_v2_collection.py)** —
  version-aware successor to the legacy `generate_postman_collection.py`; emits per-(release, category)
  Postman v2.1 collections plus an environment file under `releases/<ver>/exports/postman/`, with
  auto-split on the 50 MB cap and a top-level `postman-manifest.json`. The legacy script is kept
  untouched for backward compatibility with `tools/`.

#### UI surfaces

- **[index.html](index.html)** — version selector dropdown in the header sourced from
  `releases/index.json`; persists in `localStorage['iosxe-active-version']` and reflects in the URL
  hash as `ver=<v>`. Added quick-nav links to **Compare Versions**, **MDT Telemetry**, and **Exports**.
- **[index-app.js](index-app.js)** — `initVersionSelector()` and `applyVersion()`; exposes
  `window.__IOSXE_ACTIVE_VERSION__` so other modules can scope their fetches.
- **[search.js](search.js)** — `loadSearchIndexForActiveVersion()` tries
  `releases/<ver>/search-index.json` first and falls back to the legacy root index for
  backward compatibility.
- **[telemetry.html](telemetry.html)** — new top-level page; loads
  `releases/<ver>/telemetry-index.json`, filters by tier (HOT/WARM/COOL), on-change capability,
  and free-text, links each row back to its OpenAPI spec.
- **[exports.html](exports.html)** — new top-level page; per-release matrix of Postman + Bruno
  collections from `*-manifest.json` with size badges and download links.
- **[yang-accountability-compare.html](yang-accountability-compare.html)** — new top-level page;
  renders the cross-version comparison matrix and version-to-version add/remove deltas from
  `accountability_compare.json`.

#### Build pipeline

- **[scripts/build_release.py](scripts/build_release.py)** — pipeline now includes
  `mibs-md-parse`, switches the postman step to `generate_postman_v2_collection.py`,
  and is the single source of truth for per-release builds.
- **[.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)** — adds a
  `validate-releases` matrix job (`17.9.x`, `17.12.x`, `17.15.x`, `17.18.1`, `26.1.1`) that runs
  `scripts/validate_release.py` per cell and gates the deploy job; deploy step now copies the
  `releases/` tree into the artifact.

#### Generator migration (round 2.5)

- **[generators/_version_args.py](generators/_version_args.py)** — shared
  `resolve_paths(category, mib_subdir=False)` helper that strips `--version <ver>` from `sys.argv`
  and returns the correct `(yang_dir, output_dir, version)` tuple. Legacy 17.18.1 maps to
  `references/17181-YANG-modules/` + `swagger-<cat>-model/api/`; any other version maps to
  `releases/<ver>/yang-source/` + `releases/<ver>/swagger-<cat>-model/api/`. Backward compatible:
  generators called without `--version` retain their original behaviour.
- All 9 v2 spec generators (`generate_oper_openapi_v2.py`, `generate_cfg_openapi_v2.py`,
  `generate_native_openapi_v2.py`, `generate_openconfig_openapi_v2.py`, `generate_ietf_openapi_v2.py`,
  `generate_mib_openapi_v2.py`, `generate_other_openapi_v2.py`, `generate_events_openapi.py`,
  `generate_rpc_openapi_v2.py`) now use the shared helper in their entry points and accept
  `--version <ver>`.
- **[scripts/build_release.py](scripts/build_release.py)** — `run_step()` now captures
  stdout/stderr and, if a step fails because a generator rejects `--version` (argparse
  "unrecognized arguments"), automatically retries without the flag. Defensive shim retained for
  any non-migrated tools.

#### Per-spec MDT panel

- **[swagger-oper-model/index.html](swagger-oper-model/index.html)** — when an oper spec is
  loaded, fetches the active release's `telemetry-index.json`, filters entries to that module, and
  exposes them via a toolbar toggle that opens an inline panel listing each XPath with HOT /
  WARM / COOL tier badges, cadence, and on-change indicators. Falls back gracefully when no
  telemetry index is present.

#### Visible UI surfaces (round 3)

- **[swagger-mib-model/index.html](swagger-mib-model/index.html)** — added a MIB Details
  toolbar toggle. When opened it loads the active release's `mib-metadata.json` (with fallback to
  the legacy in-place file) and renders the loaded spec's MIB record: module / OID prefix /
  table-scalar-leaf counts / indexes / deprecated flag / latest revision / organization / RFC /
  functional category / supported platforms (as badges).
- **[swagger-native-config-model/capabilities.html](swagger-native-config-model/capabilities.html)**
  *(new)* — standalone Native config capability dashboard. Reads
  `releases/<ver>/native-capabilities.json`, shows totals (paths / operations / schemas / leafs /
  lists / choices / categories) and a sortable & filterable per-category table with deep-links into
  each category's spec in the Swagger UI viewer. Includes the standard release picker.
- **[swagger-native-config-model/index.html](swagger-native-config-model/index.html)** —
  added a Capabilities Report link in the toolbar.
- **[references/native-cli-mappings.yaml](references/native-cli-mappings.yaml)** *(new)* — curated
  YAML mapping table (~25 prefixes covering hostname, interfaces, BGP / OSPF, VLANs, AAA, SNMP,
  NTP, logging, spanning-tree, ACLs, NAT) of `path → cli` so every native operation can advertise
  its CLI equivalent.
- **[scripts/apply_cli_mappings.py](scripts/apply_cli_mappings.py)** *(new)* — overlay step that
  walks the active release's native specs (longest-prefix match, with `/data` prefix
  normalisation against the YAML keys) and stamps `x-cli-equivalent` (and optional `x-cli-notes`)
  onto every HTTP method. Verified on 17.18.1: stamps 2,372 operations across 12 spec files.
- **[references/native-example-overlay.yaml](references/native-example-overlay.yaml)** *(new)* +
  **[scripts/apply_example_overlay.py](scripts/apply_example_overlay.py)** *(new)* — curated
  request-body examples for the most common native paths (hostname, Loopback, GigE, BGP, vlan-list,
  snmp host, ntp server, aaa new-model). The applier writes the example into each PUT/PATCH/POST's
  `requestBody.content["application/yang-data+json"].example`.
- **[scripts/build_release.py](scripts/build_release.py)** — pipeline now runs
  `apply_cli_mappings.py` and `apply_example_overlay.py` between `mib-metadata` and
  `build_native_capabilities` so capability counts reflect the overlay-augmented specs.

### Fixed (round 3)

- **[scripts/build_native_capabilities.py](scripts/build_native_capabilities.py)** —
  `count_schema_features()` only counted the top-level schema and one level of properties, so the
  legacy 17.18.1 native specs (which keep most of their data shape inline under each path's
  request/response, with only one `restconf-error` schema in `components.schemas`) reported
  `leafs=0 lists=0`. Added depth-first `_walk_schema()` recursion (handles nested `properties`,
  `items`, `oneOf` / `anyOf` / `allOf`, `patternProperties`) and a new `count_path_features()` that
  walks every operation's request/response `schema`. Verified on 17.18.1: `leafs=27,312`,
  `lists=3,252` across 81 categories / 3,363 paths / 13,452 operations.
- **[scripts/validate_release.py](scripts/validate_release.py)** — gates now tolerate the legacy
  17.18.1 in-place layout (specs at repo root, `releases/17.18.1/` either missing or partially
  populated). Detects "no specs under `releases/<ver>/swagger-*-model/api/`" and re-roots to
  `PROJECT_ROOT` for 17.18.1 only. Gates 1, 4, 5 now glob `swagger-*-model/api/*.json`
  (eliminating false hits in `archive/` and other releases). Search-index, tree-audit and
  accountability files fall back to repo-root copies. Manifests without a declared `spec_count`
  emit a warning instead of failing. Verified: `validate_release.py --version 17.18.1` exits 0
  with all gates passing (666 specs parsed, 790 unique search entries).


### Fixed

- **Eliminated empty `{}` examples in 657 specs** — POST/PUT/PATCH request bodies now contain
  realistic, RFC 7951–compliant payloads.
  ([scripts/enrich_v2_specs.py](scripts/enrich_v2_specs.py))
  - Added `build_example_from_schema()` — recursively walks schema `properties` to construct
    examples from leaf types and known field-name heuristics.
  - Added `CONTAINER_FILL` (~95 templates) — maps YANG container names (e.g., `state`, `config`,
    `switchport`, `bfd`, `bgp`) to realistic structured fills.
  - Added `_build_example_from_path()` — path-based templates for VLAN, BGP, OSPF, ACL,
    AAA, NTP, SNMP, etc.
  - Added `_populate_empty_example()` — orchestrator: schema-first, path-based fallback,
    finally `[null]` for empty YANG leaves (RFC 7951 encoding).
  - **Result**: 0 empty `{}` and 0 stray `null` values across 26,331 config examples
    (verified across all 9 model categories).
- **Fixed deep-link URLs from search results** — copying/pasting a search URL now opens the
  correct module instead of the index page. ([search.js](search.js))
  - `updateUrlHash(query)` writes `#search=<query>` via `history.replaceState`.
  - `handleDeepLink()` parses three URL hash patterns on load:
    - `#search=<query>` — runs the search
    - `#module=<name>` — redirects to the module's swagger page
    - `#spec=<model>/<name>` — redirects to the model's `index.html#spec=<name>`
  - Added `hashchange` listener for browser back/forward sync.

### Added

- **`scripts/validate_examples_c9kv.py`** — Live-device validation for write-operation examples
  against a Catalyst 9000V (or any IOS XE 17.18.1+ device).
  - CLI: `--host --port --username --password --spec --method --limit --dry-run --patch-only --output`
  - 8,066 PATCH-testable examples confirmed via `--dry-run`.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — AI agent guide (build/run, conventions, pitfalls, common tasks).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Contribution workflow.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — This file.

### Changed

- **Inline JavaScript extracted from HTML pages** to comply with strict Content Security Policy:
  - [index.html](index.html) → [index-app.js](index-app.js) (341 lines)
  - [code-generator.html](code-generator.html) → [code-generator.js](code-generator.js) (345 lines)
  - [tree-compare.html](tree-compare.html) → [tree-compare.js](tree-compare.js) (332 lines)
  - [yang-accountability.html](yang-accountability.html) → [yang-accountability.js](yang-accountability.js) (254 lines)
- **CSP hardened** — `script-src 'self' cdn.jsdelivr.net`. No more `unsafe-inline`.
