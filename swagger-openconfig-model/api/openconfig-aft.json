Given this is the casee, a telemetry collector or a\n          controller that parse the AFT doesn't have a consistent\n          snapshot, or overall versioned copy of AFT with the device\n          at any specific point of time.\n\n          In certain failure modes like device boot up, gNMI daemon\n          failure and device/routing engine stateful switchover\n          a telemetry collector or a controller need a flag to\n          determine whether it is in consistent with the device or\n          not such that it can a corrective action when needed.\n          A device sets this leaf or flag to indicate to the\n          client that AFT data/view is consistent."
