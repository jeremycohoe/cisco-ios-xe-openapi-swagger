## Site usage

### Can I use this site offline?

Yes. The site is a Progressive Web App: on first visit a service worker
([service-worker.js](service-worker.js)) pre-caches the app shell (HTML, CSS, JS,
icons, manifest) and serves it offline. Spec JSON, YANG-tree HTML and search-index
files are fetched on demand and cached opportunistically. To install on
Chrome/Edge use the address-bar **Install** action; on iOS Safari use **Share →
Add to Home Screen**.

When a new build is deployed and you have an open tab, a small bottom-right
**Reload** card appears (Tier-9 update-available toast). Click **Reload** to
activate the new version; the page refreshes exactly once.

### Can I run the site locally / on an internal server / in an air-gapped network?

Yes &mdash; `git clone` and `python -m http.server 8000`. The repo vendors
every third-party library (Swagger UI, Fuse.js, Chart.js) under
`assets/vendor/` with SHA-384 SRI verification, drops Google Fonts in favour
of the system font stack, and enforces `default-src 'self'` CSP. The only
outbound dependency is **Microsoft Clarity** analytics (`*.clarity.ms`), which
is loaded by the public GitHub Pages site; remove the Clarity block at the top
of `assets/js/sw-register.js` (and the `*.clarity.ms` CSP entries) for a
**zero outbound traffic** air-gapped deployment. See
[docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md) for nginx / IIS / Apache
recipes, security hardening, and a minimum file set for production.

### How do I find APIs for Catalyst 9k / IOS XE features?

Three entry points, in order of precision:

1. **Universal search** on the [home page](index.html) — type any keyword
   (`bgp`, `interface`, `mac-address`, `crypto`...). Results group by module
   *and* now surface individual operations (Tier-7 hub-search-ops).
2. **Per-category viewers** (`swagger-cfg-model/`, `swagger-oper-model/`,
   `swagger-native-config-model/`, `swagger-ietf-model/`,
   `swagger-openconfig-model/`, `swagger-mib-model/`, `swagger-rpc-model/`,
   `swagger-events-model/`, `swagger-other-model/`) — each ships a paths-search
   box that walks every spec chunk and deep-links into the right operation.
3. **YANG accountability** — [yang-accountability.html](yang-accountability.html)
   maps every IOS XE YANG module to its category, spec presence, and (when
   excluded) the documented reason.

Use the version selector in the top nav to switch between 17.9.x, 17.12.x,
17.15.x, 17.18.1 and 26.1.1.

### How do I validate config on a real device?

This site only documents the API surface — it does not push config. Use one of:

* **Postman / Bruno collections** — see "Postman / Bruno exports" below.
* **Code generator** — [code-generator.html](code-generator.html) emits ready-to-run
  curl, Python (`requests`), Ansible, Go and JavaScript snippets for any
  operation, with the device IP, credentials and CSRF/Token plumbing pre-wired.
* **RESTCONF** — every operation page exposes the canonical RESTCONF URL
  (`https://<device>/restconf/data/...`); pair with `Accept:
  application/yang-data+json` and HTTP basic auth (or the configured AAA scheme).
* **NETCONF** — for the `swagger-rpc-model` category, use `<rpc>` over port 830;
  payloads are JSON-Schema mirrors of the YANG `input`/`output` containers.

Always test config changes on a lab device first. The
[release-validate gates](VERSIONING.md#9-release-validate-gates) confirm spec
shape, but only a real device confirms semantics.

### How do I subscribe to MDT (Model-Driven Telemetry)?

* Open [telemetry.html](telemetry.html). The page is generated from
  `releases/<ver>/telemetry-index.json` and lists every YANG xpath that has
  passed the `mdt-annotate` build step's xpath-sanity gate.
* Each entry includes the canonical xpath, recommended period, and a copy-to-
  clipboard YANG-Push subscription template (`establish-subscription` over
  NETCONF, plus a gNMI/dial-out variant).
* For end-to-end pipelines (collector + decoder + dashboard) see the
  [telemetry-reference-v2.md](telemetry-reference-v2.md) cookbook.

### How do shareable deep-links work?

Every URL the **Copy Share Link** button produces uses a fixed hash format
so the link opens directly on the same spec, operation, and IOS XE release:

```
https://<host>/<category>/index.html?ver=<release>#ver=<release>&spec=<module>&op=<operationId>
```

* `?ver=` and `#ver=` carry the active release (e.g. `26.1.1`). The viewer
  reads from the query first; the hash copy is what survives reloads and
  what other tooling (e.g. `recent-favorites.js`) snapshots.
* `#spec=` is the YANG module file name without the `.json` extension
  (e.g. `Cisco-IOS-XE-native`).
* `#op=` is the OpenAPI `operationId`, which the build step makes globally
  unique so the same hash always lands on exactly one operation.

If the spec doesn't exist in the requested release the viewer surfaces a
yellow toast and falls back to the module list. If you land on a 404 page,
[404.html](404.html) parses the same hash and forwards you to the nearest
correct viewer automatically.

**Keyboard shortcuts:** `/` or `Ctrl+K` focuses the search box on the home
page and every viewer.

### Can I see real data from a device, not just the schema example?

Yes. [live-data.html](live-data.html) shows **real RESTCONF GET responses
captured from physical Catalyst switches** (e.g. C9300 / C9400 / C9500 / C9600 on
IOS XE 26.1.1). Pick a device platform tab, then drill into a module and path to
see exactly what that switch returned; per-category coverage cards show how much
was captured for the selected device.

The same captures are embedded in each spec as the `x-cisco-live-examples`
vendor extension (keyed by device PID) alongside the synthetic schema `example`,
and every `swagger-*-model` viewer shows a "Live device data" banner that
deep-links into the browser. Coverage is a snapshot — not every path is captured,
and it is read-only sample data, so treat it as illustrative rather than
exhaustive.

## Postman / Bruno exports

### Where are the collections?

[exports.html](exports.html) lists every release that has a populated
`releases/<ver>/exports/` directory. Per-category Postman v2.1 collections live
under `releases/<ver>/exports/postman/` and a Postman environment file ships
alongside.

Bruno collection bodies are git-ignored to keep the repo size bounded; only
the `bruno-manifest.json` ships. Regenerate them locally:

```bash
python scripts/generate_bruno_collection.py --version 26.1.1 --per-category --max-mb 50
```

The same script exists for Postman:

```bash
python scripts/generate_postman_v2_collection.py --version 26.1.1 --per-category --max-mb 50
```

### Why are collections split per category?

A single combined collection would exceed Postman's practical import limit and
the 50 MB per-collection gate enforced by
[scripts/validate_release.py](scripts/validate_release.py) gate 7. Splitting by
category (cfg / oper / native-config / ietf / openconfig / mib / rpc / events /
other) keeps each collection import-sized and lets users pull only the surface
they need.

### Can I use the OpenAPI specs directly?

Yes. Each spec under `releases/<ver>/swagger-<cat>-model/api/*.json` is a
self-contained OpenAPI 3.0 document. Use it with any OpenAPI-aware tool
(openapi-generator, Stoplight, Insomnia, Bruno's OpenAPI import, etc.). The
specs are also rendered live in the per-category Swagger-UI viewers on the site.

## Contributing / build

### How do I add a new release?

See [VERSIONING.md §8 — Adding a new release: runbook](VERSIONING.md#8-adding-a-new-release--runbook).
Short version: add the YangModels submodule, run `python scripts/build_release.py
--version <new-ver>`, validate with `python scripts/validate_release.py --version
<new-ver>`, then commit and push.

### Where do I report a problem?

Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cisco-ios-xe-openapi-swagger/issues).
Include the release, viewer category, and module name (or screenshot of the
operation row). PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
