    "description": "This MIB contains managed object definitions for\n    encapsulating TDM (T1,E1, T3, E3, NxDS0) as\n    pseudo-wires over packet-switching networks (PSN).\n    \n    This MIB supplements the CISCO-IETF-PW-MIB.\n    The CISCO-IETF-PW-MIB contains structures and MIB\n    associations generic to Pseudo-Wire (PW) emulation.\n    PW-specific MIBs (such as this) contain config and stats for\n    specific PW types.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",
