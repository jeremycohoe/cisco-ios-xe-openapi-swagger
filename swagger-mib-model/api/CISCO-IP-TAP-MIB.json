CISCO-TAP2-MIB along with\n    specific filter MIBs like this MIB replace \n    CISCO-TAP-MIB.\n    \n    To create an IP intercept, an entry citapStreamEntry \n    is created which contains the filter details. An entry\n    cTap2StreamEntry of CISCO-TAP2-MIB is created, which is\n    the common stream information for all kinds of \n    intercepts and type of the specific stream is set to\n    ip in this entry.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",

If routing changes, either by operator action\n            or by routing protocol events, the interface will change with\n            it. This is primarily intended for use on subscriber interfaces\n            and other places where routing is guaranteed to be\n            symmetrical.\n            \n            \n            In both of these cases, it is possible to have the same packet\n            selected for intersection on both its ingress and egress\n            interface.  Nonetheless, only one instance of the packet is\n            sent to the Mediation Device.\n            \n            \n            If the value is -2, packets belonging to a Voice over IP (VoIP)\n            session identified by citapStreamSourceAddress, \n            citapStreamSourceLen and citapStreamSourceL4PortMin may be \n            intercepted, as a specific voice session can be identified \n            with source IP address and udp port number. Other selection \n            parameters may be not considered, even if they are set by \n            the Mediation Device.\n            \n            \n            This value must be set when creating a stream entry, either to\n            select an interface, to select all interfaces, or to select the\n            interface that routing chooses. Some platforms may not\n            implement the entire range of options.",
