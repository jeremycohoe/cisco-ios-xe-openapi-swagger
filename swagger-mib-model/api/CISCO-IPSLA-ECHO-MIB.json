    "description": "This MIB module defines the templates for IP SLA operations of\n    ICMP echo, UDP echo and TCP connect.\n    \n    The ICMP echo operation measures end-to-end response time between \n    a Cisco router and any IP enabled device by computing the time\n    taken between sending an ICMP echo request message to the \n    destination and receiving an ICMP echo reply.\n    \n    \n    The UDP echo operation measures end-to-end response time between \n    a Cisco router and any IP enabled device by computing the time\n    taken between sending an UDP echo request message to the \n    destination and receiving an UDP echo reply.\n    \n    The TCP connect operation measures end-to-end response time between \n    a Cisco router and any IP enabled device by computing the time\n    taken to perform a TCP connect operation.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",
