    "description": "Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF) is a function that\n    checks the validity of the source address of IP packets\n    received on an interface. This in an attempt to prevent\n    Denial of Service attacks based on IP address spoofing.\n    \n    URPF checks validity of a source address by determining\n    whether the packet would be successfully routed as a\n    destination address. \n    Based on configuration, the check made\n    can be for existence of any route for the address, or more\n    strictly for a route out the interface on which the packet\n    was received by the device. When a violating packet is\n    detected, it can be dropped. \n    This MIB allows detection of\n    spoofingevents.\n\n⚠️ **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n\n\n**📊 YANG Tree:** [View CISCO-IP-URPF-MIB structure](https://jeremycohoe.github.io/cisco-ios-xe-openapi-swagger/yang-trees/CISCO-IP-URPF-MIB.html)",

The\n            per-interface drop rate notification is issued on rates\n            exceeding a limit (rising rate). This dropping may indicate\n            an security attack on the network. To determine whether the\n            attack/event is over, the NMS must consult the managed\n            device. This object can be polled to determine the recent\n            drop rate for the managed device as a whole, in addition to\n            querying particular interface objects. \n            This object is the\n            average rate of dropping over the most recent window of\n            time. The rate is computed by dividing the number of packets\n            dropped over a window by the window time in seconds. The\n            window time is specified by cipUrpfDropRateWindow. Each time\n            the drop rate is computed, and at system startup, a snapshot\n            is taken of the latest value of cipUrpfDrops. Subtracting\n            from this the snapshot of cipUrpfDrops at the start of the\n            current window of time gives the number of packets dropped.\n            The drop rate is computed every cipUrpfComputeInterval\n            seconds. As an example, let cipUrpfDropRateWindow be 300\n            seconds, and cipUrpfComputeInterval 30 seconds. Every 30\n            seconds, the drop count five minutes previous is subtracted\n            from the current drop count, and the result is divided by\n            300 to arrive at the drop rate. \n            At device start-up, until\n            the device has been up more than cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when\n            drop rate is computed, the value of cipUrpfDrops is divided\n            by the time the device has been up. \n            After the device has\n            been up for cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when drop rate is\n            computed, the number of packet drops counted from interval\n            start time to the computation time is divided by\n            cipUrpfDropRateWindow. \n            Changes to cipUrpfDropRateWindow are\n            not reflected in this object until the next computation\n            time. \n            The rate from the most recent computation is the\n            value fetched until the subsequent computation is\n            performed.",

To determine whether the\n            attack/event is over, the NMS must consult the managed\n            device. This object can be polled to determine the recent\n            drop rate for the managed device as a whole, in addition to\n            querying particular interface objects. \n            This object is the\n            average rate of dropping over the most recent window of\n            time. The rate is computed by dividing the number of packets\n            dropped over a window by the window time in seconds. The\n            window time is specified by cipUrpfDropRateWindow. Each time\n            the drop rate is computed, and at system startup, a snapshot\n            is taken of the latest value of cipUrpfDrops. Subtracting\n            from this the snapshot of cipUrpfDrops at the start of the\n            current window of time gives the number of packets dropped.\n            The drop rate is computed every cipUrpfComputeInterval\n            seconds. As an example, let cipUrpfDropRateWindow be 300\n            seconds, and cipUrpfComputeInterval 30 seconds. Every 30\n            seconds, the drop count five minutes previous is subtracted\n            from the current drop count, and the result is divided by\n            300 to arrive at the drop rate. \n            At device start-up, until\n            the device has been up more than cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when\n            drop rate is computed, the value of cipUrpfDrops is divided\n            by the time the device has been up. \n            After the device has\n            been up for cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when drop rate is\n            computed, the number of packet drops counted from interval\n            start time to the computation time is divided by\n            cipUrpfDropRateWindow. \n            Changes to cipUrpfDropRateWindow are\n            not reflected in this object until the next computation\n            time. \n            The rate from the most recent computation is the\n            value fetched until the subsequent computation is\n            performed.",

The\n            per-interface drop rate notification is issued on rates\n            exceeding a limit (rising rate). This dropping may indicate\n            an security attack on the network. To determine whether the\n            attack/event is over, the NMS must consult the managed\n            device. This object can be polled to determine the recent\n            drop rate for the managed device as a whole, in addition to\n            querying particular interface objects. \n            This object is the\n            average rate of dropping over the most recent window of\n            time. The rate is computed by dividing the number of packets\n            dropped over a window by the window time in seconds. The\n            window time is specified by cipUrpfDropRateWindow. Each time\n            the drop rate is computed, and at system startup, a snapshot\n            is taken of the latest value of cipUrpfDrops. Subtracting\n            from this the snapshot of cipUrpfDrops at the start of the\n            current window of time gives the number of packets dropped.\n            The drop rate is computed every cipUrpfComputeInterval\n            seconds. As an example, let cipUrpfDropRateWindow be 300\n            seconds, and cipUrpfComputeInterval 30 seconds. Every 30\n            seconds, the drop count five minutes previous is subtracted\n            from the current drop count, and the result is divided by\n            300 to arrive at the drop rate. \n            At device start-up, until\n            the device has been up more than cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when\n            drop rate is computed, the value of cipUrpfDrops is divided\n            by the time the device has been up. \n            After the device has\n            been up for cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when drop rate is\n            computed, the number of packet drops counted from interval\n            start time to the computation time is divided by\n            cipUrpfDropRateWindow. \n            Changes to cipUrpfDropRateWindow are\n            not reflected in this object until the next computation\n            time. \n            The rate from the most recent computation is the\n            value fetched until the subsequent computation is\n            performed.",

Subtracting from this\n            the snapshot of cipUrpfIfDrops at the start of the current\n            interval of time gives the number of packets dropped.\n            The drop rate is computed every cipUrpfComputeInterval\n            seconds.\n            \n            When drop rate is computed, if time since the creation of \n            a row in cipUrpfIfMonTable is less than \n            cipUrpfDropRateWindow, the value of cipUrpfIfDrops is \n            divided by the time since row was created.\n            \n            After the row has been in existence for \n            cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when drop rate is computed, the \n            number of packet drops counted on the interface from \n            interval start time to the computation time is divided \n            by cipUrpfDropRateWindow.\n            \n            Changes to cipUrpfDropRateWindow are not reflected in this\n            object until the next computation time.\n            \n            The rate from the  most recent computation is the value \n            fetched until the subsequent computation is performed.",
