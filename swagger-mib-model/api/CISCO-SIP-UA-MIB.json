    "description": "Cisco User Agent Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \n    MIB module.  SIP is an application-layer signalling\n    protocol for creating, modifying and terminating\n    multimedia sessions with one or more participants.\n    These sessions include Internet multimedia conferences\n    and Internet telephone calls.  SIP is defined in \n    RFC 2543 (March 1999).  \n    \n    This MIB is defined for the management of SIP User \n    Agents (UAs).  A User Agent is an application which \n    contains both a User Agent Client (UAC) and a User \n    Agent Server (UAS).   A UAC is an application that \n    initiates a SIP request.  A UAS is an application that \n    contacts the user when a SIP request is received and \n    that returns a response on behalf of the user.  The \n    response accepts, rejects, or redirects the request.\n    \n    A SIP transaction occurs between a client and a server \n    and comprises all messages from the first request sent\n    from the client to the server up to a final (non-1xx) \n    response sent from the server to the client.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",
