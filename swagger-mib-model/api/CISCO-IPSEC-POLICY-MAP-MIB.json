This is an appendix to the\n    IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB that has been proposed to\n    IETF for monitoring IPSec based Virtual Private \n    Networks.\n    \n    Overview of Cisco IPsec Policy Map MIB\n    \n    MIB description\n    \n    There are two components to this MIB:  \n      #1 a table that maps an IPSec Phase-1 \n         tunnel to the Internet Security Association \n         and Key Exchange (ISAKMP) Policy \n         \n      and \n    \n      #2 a table that maps an IPSec Phase-2 \n         tunnel to the corresponding IPSec Policy\n         element - called 'cryptomaps' - in IOS \n         (Internet Operating System)\n    \n    The first mappin (also called Internet Key Exchange\n     or IKE mapping) yields, given the index of\n    the IKE tunnel in the ikeTunnelTable\n    (IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB), the ISAKMP policy definition\n    defined using the CLI on the managed entity.\n    \n    The IPSec mapping yields, given the index\n    of the IPSec tunnel in the ipSecTunnelTable\n    (IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB), the IPSec transform and\n    the cryptomap definition that gave rise to\n    this tunnel.\n    \n    In implementation and usage, this MIB cannot\n    exist independent of the IPSEC-MONITOR-MIB.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",
