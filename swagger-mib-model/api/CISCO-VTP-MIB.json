This value is useful for\n            overriding the default behavior of some switches.

This value is useful for\n            overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the\n            negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take\n            place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the\n            far end into non-trunking state.\n            \n            desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for\n            the interface to become a trunk.  The device will initiate\n            any negotiation necessary to become a trunk but will not\n            become a trunk unless it receives confirmation from the far\n            end on the link.\n            \n            auto(4) is used to indicate that the interface is capable\n            and willing to become a trunk but will not initiate\n            trunking negotiations.  The far end on the link are\n            required to either start negotiations or start sending\n            encapsulated packets, on which event the specified\n            interface will become a trunk.\n            \n            onNoNegotiate(5) is used to indicate that the interface is\n            permanently set to be a trunk, and no negotiation takes\n            place with the far end on the link to ensure consistent\n            operation. This is similar to on(1) except no negotiation\n            takes place with the far end.\n            \n            If the port does not support negotiation or its\n            vlanTrunkPortEncapsulationType is set to negotiate(5),\n            onNoNegotiate(5) is not allowed.\n            \n            Devices that do no support dynamic determination (for just\n            a particular interface, encapsulation or for the whole\n            device) need only support the 'on', and 'off' values."

This is the value for static entries (those that\n            show no dynamic behavior). If the negotiation is supported\n            on this port, negotiation will take place with the far end\n            to attempt to bring the far end into trunking state.\n            \n            off(2) allows an operator to specify that the specified\n            interface is never to be trunk, regardless of any dynamic\n            mechanisms to the contrary.  This value is useful for\n            overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the\n            negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take\n            place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the\n            far end into non-trunking state.\n            \n            desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for\n            the interface to become a trunk.

This is the value for static entries (those that\n            show no dynamic behavior). If the negotiation is supported\n            on this port, negotiation will take place with the far end\n            to attempt to bring the far end into trunking state.\n            \n            off(2) allows an operator to specify that the specified\n            interface is never to be trunk, regardless of any dynamic\n            mechanisms to the contrary.  This value is useful for\n            overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the\n            negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take\n            place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the\n            far end into non-trunking state.\n            \n            desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for\n            the interface to become a trunk.

This is the value for static entries (those that\n            show no dynamic behavior). If the negotiation is supported\n            on this port, negotiation will take place with the far end\n            to attempt to bring the far end into trunking state.\n            \n            off(2) allows an operator to specify that the specified\n            interface is never to be trunk, regardless of any dynamic\n            mechanisms to the contrary.  This value is useful for\n            overriding the default behavior of some switches. If the\n            negotiation is supported on this port, negotiation will take\n            place with the far end to attempt on the link to bring the\n            far end into non-trunking state.\n            \n            desirable(3) is used to indicate that it is desirable for\n            the interface to become a trunk.  The device will initiate\n            any negotiation necessary to become a trunk but will not\n            become a trunk unless it receives confirmation from the far\n            end on the link.\n            \n            auto(4) is used to indicate that the interface is capable\n            and willing to become a trunk but will not initiate\n            trunking negotiations.  The far end on the link are\n            required to either start negotiations or start sending\n            encapsulated packets, on which event the specified\n            interface will become a trunk.\n            \n            onNoNegotiate(5) is used to indicate that the interface is\n            permanently set to be a trunk, and no negotiation takes\n            place with the far end on the link to ensure consistent\n            operation. This is similar to on(1) except no negotiation\n            takes place with the far end.\n            \n            If the port does not support negotiation or its\n            vlanTrunkPortEncapsulationType is set to negotiate(5),\n            onNoNegotiate(5) is not allowed.\n            \n            Devices that do no support dynamic determination (for just\n            a particular interface, encapsulation or for the whole\n            device) need only support the 'on', and 'off' values."

The far end on the link are\n            required to either start negotiations or start sending\n            encapsulated packets, on which event the specified\n            interface will become a trunk.\n            \n            onNoNegotiate(5) is used to indicate that the interface is\n            permanently set to be a trunk, and no negotiation takes\n            place with the far end on the link to ensure consistent\n            operation.
