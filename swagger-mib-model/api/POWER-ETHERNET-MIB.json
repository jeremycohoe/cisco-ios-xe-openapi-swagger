    "description": "The MIB module for managing Power Source Equipment\n    (PSE) working according to the IEEE 802.af Powered\n    Ethernet (DTE Power via MDI) standard.\n    \n     The following terms are used throughout this\n     MIB module.  For complete formal definitions,\n     the IEEE 802.3 standards should be consulted\n     wherever possible:\n    \n     Group - A recommended, but optional, entity\n     defined by the IEEE 802.3 management standard,\n     in order to support a modular numbering scheme.\n     The classical example allows an implementor to\n     represent field-replaceable units as groups of\n     ports, with the port numbering matching the\n     modular hardware implementation.\n    \n    Port - This entity identifies the port within the group\n    for which this entry contains information.  The numbering\n    scheme for ports is implementation specific.\n    \n    Copyright (c) The Internet Society (2003).  This version\n    of this MIB module is part of RFC 3621; See the RFC\n    itself for full legal notices.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",
