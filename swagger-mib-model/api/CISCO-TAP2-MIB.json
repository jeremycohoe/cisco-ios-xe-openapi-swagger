    "description": "This module manages Cisco's intercept feature.\n    This MIB replaces CISCO-TAP-MIB. This MIB defines\n    a generic stream table that contains fields common to\n    all intercept types. Specific intercept filters are\n    defined in extension MIBs. They are CISCO-IP-TAP-MIB\n    for IP intercepts, CISCO-802-TAP-MIB for IEEE 802\n    intercepts and CISCO-USER-CONNECTION-TAP-MIB for\n    RADIUS-based user connection intercepts.\n\n⚠️ **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n\n\n**📊 YANG Tree:** [View CISCO-TAP2-MIB structure](https://jeremycohoe.github.io/cisco-ios-xe-openapi-swagger/yang-trees/CISCO-TAP2-MIB.html)",
