This MIB defines\n    objects for managing remote network monitoring devices.\n\n⚠️ **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n\n\n**📊 YANG Tree:** [View RMON-MIB structure](https://jeremycohoe.github.io/cisco-ios-xe-openapi-swagger/yang-trees/RMON-MIB.html)",

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section\n            10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a\n            station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if\n            three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A\n            repeater port must detect a collision when two or more\n            stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe\n            placed on a repeater port could record more collisions\n            than a probe connected to a station on the same segment\n            would.\n            \n            Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering\n            10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3\n            defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals\n            on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving\n            at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on\n            a station and a repeater, should report the same number of\n            collisions.\n            \n            Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should\n            ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or\n            more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE\n            802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax\n            segments to which the repeater is connected.",

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section\n            10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a\n            station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if\n            three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A\n            repeater port must detect a collision when two or more\n            stations are transmitting simultaneously.

A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on\n            a station and a repeater, should report the same number of\n            collisions.\n            \n            Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should\n            ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or\n            more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE\n            802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax\n            segments to which the repeater is connected.",

A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.

Thus a probe\n            placed on a repeater port could record more collisions\n            than a probe connected to a station on the same segment\n            would.\n            \n            Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering\n            10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3\n            defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals\n            on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving\n            at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on\n            a station and a repeater, should report the same number of\n            collisions.\n            \n            Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should\n            ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or\n            more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE\n            802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax\n            segments to which the repeater is connected.",

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section\n            10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a\n            station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if\n            three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A\n            repeater port must detect a collision when two or more\n            stations are transmitting simultaneously.

A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on\n            a station and a repeater, should report the same number of\n            collisions.\n            \n            Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should\n            ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or\n            more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE\n            802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax\n            segments to which the repeater is connected.",

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section\n            10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a\n            station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if\n            three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.

A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section\n            10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a\n            station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if\n            three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.  A\n            repeater port must detect a collision when two or more\n            stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe\n            placed on a repeater port could record more collisions\n            than a probe connected to a station on the same segment\n            would.\n            \n            Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering\n            10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3\n            defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals\n            on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving\n            at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on\n            a station and a repeater, should report the same number of\n            collisions.\n            \n            Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should\n            ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or\n            more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE\n            802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax\n            segments to which the repeater is connected.",

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section\n            10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a\n            station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if\n            three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously.

A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.

A 10BASE-T station can only detect\n            collisions when it is transmitting.
