    "description": "The MIB module provides a means to monitor and configure\n    the Cisco IOS proprietary Hot Standby Router Protocol\n    (HSRP). Cisco HSRP protocol is defined in RFC2281.\n    \n    Terminology:\n    \n    HSRP is a protocol used amoung a group of routers for the\n    purpose of selecting an 'active router' and a 'standby\n    router'.\n    \n    An 'active router' is the router of choice for routing\n    packets.\n    \n    A 'standby router' is a router that takes over the routing\n    duties when an active router fails, or when preset\n    conditions have been met.\n    \n    An 'HSRP group' or a 'standby group' is a set of routers\n    which communicate using HSRP. An HSRP group has a group MAC\n    address and a group Virtual IP address. These are the\n    designated addresses. The active router assumes (i.e.\n    inherits) these group addresses.\n    \n    'Hello' messages are sent to indicate that a router is\n    running and is capable of becoming the active or standby\n    router.\n    \n    'Hellotime' is the interval between successive HSRP Hello\n    messages from a given router.\n    \n    'Holdtime' is the interval between the receipt of a Hello\n    message and the presumption that the sending router has\n    failed.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **IMPORTANT - MIB DATA ACCESS**:\nThis YANG model exists for SMIv2-to-YANG translation purposes, but MIB data on IOS-XE devices is primarily accessed via **SNMP protocol**, not RESTCONF.\n\n**RESTCONF Limitation**: Many MIB paths may return 404 errors via RESTCONF `/data` endpoints because the device exposes MIB data through SNMP, not the YANG datastore.\n\n**Recommended Access Methods**:\n- Use SNMP (v2c/v3) to query MIB data directly\n- Use NETCONF `<get>` operations for devices supporting YANG-modeled MIB access\n- Check device capabilities: some newer IOS-XE versions may support limited RESTCONF access to specific MIBs\n\n**YANG Model Purpose**: These YANG models define the structure of SNMP MIBs in YANG format for tooling compatibility, but do not guarantee RESTCONF data availability.\n",
